Sequence Diagram â€“ Crazy 8 Game 
This version represents the order of interactions between the different objects/classes during a player turn followed by an AI turn.

ğŸ§± Objects:
Player â€“ Human user

GameEngine â€“ The logic controller

RuleChecker â€“ Validates card rules

Deck â€“ Holds remaining cards

DiscardPile â€“ Holds played cards

AI â€“ Computer opponent

ğŸ§  Commentary
This flow shows a complete cycle:

The Player plays a card â†’ validation â†’ update discard pile â†’ check win.

Then the AI performs a similar sequence, automatically.

The GameEngine orchestrates the entire process by invoking functions on the Deck, RuleChecker, and DiscardPile.

The AI is abstracted here but would have logic to choose a valid card or draw one.

This is a blueprint for your JavaScript class and function design:

playCard(card)

isValid(card)

updateDiscard(card)

checkWinCondition()

aiTurn()

switchTurn()
