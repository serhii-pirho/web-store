📝 Commentary
This version gives you a full picture of what needs to be implemented:

It clearly distinguishes between user, AI, and system responsibilities.

You can now use this structure to break down development into functions or modules.

Each use case here corresponds to a piece of logic you’ll implement in HTML/JS (e.g., drawCard(), checkWinCondition() etc.)
